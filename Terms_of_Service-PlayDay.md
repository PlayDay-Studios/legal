### Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Company and You regarding the Service, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Company and You regarding the Service.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Company' prior written consent.

If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by JAMS. The arbitrator's decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, and can enforced like any other court order or judgment.

You are responsible for ensuring that PlayDay receives your opt-out notice, so you may wish to send it by a means that provides for a delivery receipt. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, PlayDay will not be bound by them with respect to disputes with you.

### General Health Notice
**WARNINGS: READ BEFORE PLAYING OR WATCHING**
**Photo-sensitivity / seizures warning**
A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these "photosensitive epileptic seizures" while watching video games.
These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eyes or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.
Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued.
If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.
